It is interesting to consider the difference between having a stereo camera and the situation in monocular SLAM where a single camera takes images from two locations, separated by time. One could argue that a monocular camera observing a static scene from two locations separated by some baseline would give exactly the same information as a stereo camera. Indeed, this is the case, assuming the distance the camera has moved is known: if the distance between the two camera positions is known this introduces a real scale reference just as in stereo.
